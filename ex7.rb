# watch that print vs. puts on this line what's it do?
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6 # will add the letters as one and print a the word "Cheese"
puts end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12 # adds the letters as one and still prints the word "Burger" puts and print seems to not differ in this code!
